2016-02-06T19:51:37.056966+00:00	@ruebot did you add a post_tweet_hook like this? http://edsu.github.io/twtxt/config.txt
2016-02-06T20:03:54.442058+00:00	trying to see how I can make git commit/push silently
2016-02-06T20:08:58.219287+00:00	maybe -q will do the trick? http://edsu.github.io/twtxt/config.txt
