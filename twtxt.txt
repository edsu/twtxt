2016-02-06T19:19:28.855813+00:00	just setting up my twtxt
2016-02-06T19:33:19.839105+00:00	@ruebot it's kinda interesting that nicks are just local aliases for twtxt urls
2016-02-06T19:51:37.056966+00:00	@ruebot did you add a post_tweet_hook like this? http://edsu.github.io/twtxt/config.txt
2016-02-06T20:03:54.442058+00:00	trying to see how I can make git commit/push silently
2016-02-06T20:08:58.219287+00:00	maybe -q will do the trick? http://edsu.github.io/twtxt/config.txt
2016-02-06T20:09:57.954151+00:00	that seemed to work, yay .... uh yeah
2016-02-06T20:11:13.684652+00:00	now I'm feeling guilty for having abandoned http://tilde.club/~edsu/
2016-02-06T20:12:56.078574+00:00	@rubebot add a -q on the commit & push?
2016-02-06T20:20:45.177858+00:00	it is interesting how the registries like http://twtxt.reednj.com/ are the things enforcing that nicks are unique
2016-02-06T20:22:51.125929+00:00	@ruebot makes sense ; I did this git config push.default simple
2016-02-06T20:24:50.859317+00:00	hmm now polling or push notifications ... :)
2016-02-06T20:27:11.501578+00:00	@ruebot I kinda wish the config was part of the twtxt file, so you could see who people are following
2016-02-06T20:31:30.405596+00:00	@buckket did you consider having [following] in the twtxt file itself, so people could see who other people were following?
2016-02-06T22:44:39.840460+00:00	@cm_harlow hey there!
2016-02-07T09:51:31-05:00	trying out v1.1.0
2016-02-07T09:53:31-05:00	added these aliases to my .profile to make sending/receiving a bit easier
2016-02-07T09:54:13-05:00	oops I forgot the url in my last message https://gist.github.com/edsu/855230f4754d6d11844d
2016-02-07T15:09:38-05:00	this is starting to feel dumb
2016-02-08T12:09:41-05:00	/me waves to @escowles https://escowles.github.io/tw.txt
